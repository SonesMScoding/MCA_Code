    <h1>My Favorite Website.</h1>
    <b> <a href="https://flockmod.com/draw/" target="_blank">FlockMod</a> </b> 

    <h4>Flockmod is one of my favorite websites, but it does not represent my character well. I like to draw myself and my friends in the whiteboard chat rooms, but stranger danger is real.</h4>

    <h2>Anything drawn in Flockmod is not representative of me as a person.</h2>

    <p>any way here is a flockmod drawing I did :3</p>
