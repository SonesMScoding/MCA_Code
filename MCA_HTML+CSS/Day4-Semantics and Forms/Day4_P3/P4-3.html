            <h3>Whats the deal with uncanny, brain dead developed websites making gum creepy for no good reason?</h3>

            <p>Turns out when a task is super tedious but better than doing nothing, random insignificant things in everyday life will take over rather than any good creative idea to bring depth to a task with little depth. Anyway, did you know the first gum came out as sap from a tree. Do you think about trees when you chew gum? How often do you think about the roman empire? Happens to be the trees lived in the roman empire that we have the long related candy known as bubble gum today. Crazy. I was crazy once.</p>
