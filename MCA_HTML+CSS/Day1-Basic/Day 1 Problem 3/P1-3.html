    <h1><b>My Profile: </b></h1>
    <p> My name is Everett. I am 22 years old. I hold the mentality that I can learn and accomplish any task with time and patience. Determination and motivation are absolutely necessary to excel in software development as well as a keen sense of googling questions.</p>

    <h2><b>Why Software Development?</b></h2>
    <p>Software development was not the career path I thought I would take. I could do anything that involves creating something. Anything that isn't construction, but I can still create is what attracted me to software development. After doing it for a little while, a part of my brain developed that made learning coding material easier. I like it and I am determined.</p>
