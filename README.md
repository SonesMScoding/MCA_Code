Hello! I started attending the Mississippi Coding Academy in Biloxi January 27, 2025. 
I have coding experience and May 2025 I will graduate with my bachelor's in applied technology.
I would love to focus on software development in my long term career so I am very grateful for the opportunity to hone skills and network.

Most of these repositories will be work done in class.
